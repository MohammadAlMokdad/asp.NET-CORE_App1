# ASP.NET Core Web App with Authentication and Student Management

This is my first ASP.NET Core web application, built using ASP.NET Core MVC. The project includes all the scaffolded items provided by ASP.NET Core, such as user authentication (login, signup, password management), and basic CRUD operations.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Built-in login and signup pages generated using ASP.NET Core scaffolding.
- **Student Management:** Simple CRUD functionality to manage student records, including:
  - Adding a new student (ID and Name).
  - Viewing the list of students.
  - Editing existing student information.
  - Deleting student records.
- **Responsive UI:** Uses the default Bootstrap template for a modern and clean look.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- Bootstrap (default template)
- SQL Server (for data storage)
